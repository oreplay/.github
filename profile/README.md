# O-Replay

[oreplay.es](oreplay.es) is a free web service that aims to provide a modern, user-friendly and open source hub to all orienteering events. Live and final results can be uploaded to be displayed during and after the event.

Unlike other main platforms such as [liveresultats](https://liveresultat.orientering.se/) we are working on the support of all kinds of orienteering events, not just O-foot competitions. Results for relay, score or Trail-O can be uploaded as well

The project is under active development and no release has been made so far.

## Development team

We are a group of Spanish timekeepers that have deeply fallen in love with orienteering. For that reason, we are volunteering in developing this web service.

We have to acknowledge the support from the Spanish Orienteering Federation and, specially, the Galician Orienteering Federation (Galicia is a region at the north-west coast of Spain). 

## Repositories
The project is broken down into three different repositories.

- [oreplay](https://github.com/oreplay/oreplay-backend): back-end of the web application
- [oreplay-react](https://github.com/oreplay/oreplay-frontend): front-end of the web application
- [desktop-client](https://github.com/oreplay/desktop-client): Client to upload results from external timekeeping software.
